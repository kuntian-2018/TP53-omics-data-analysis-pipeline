Introduction
All the original reads files generated from Illumina HiSeq2500 were stored in the foramt of FASTQ.
FASTQ files were downloaded from the EGA by the client and deencypted.
Then these files were mapped by the TopHat2 software via the command line programm on the Unix client.
Here is an example of the TopHat2 command:
tophat2 -p 10 /home/kun/bowtie/tophat-2.1.1.Linux_x86_64/test_data2/Homo_sapiens/Ensembl/GRCh37/Sequence/Bowtie2Index/genome _EGAR00001406176_ega_meso_rna_9259750_1_1.gne.fastq _EGAR00001406176_ega_meso_rna_9259750_1_2.gne.fastq
There are 10 threads of the core utilized for the alignment work by TopHat2 and the reference is Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.63.gtf.
BAM file was generated for the alignment and processed by R scripts to export the count matrix for the differential expression analysis and the count matrix based statistical analysis.
All the R scripts for the differential expression analysis and the count matrix based statistical analysis, were pushed in this folder.
